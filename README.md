Read Java keystore (jks) files using Go

## Legal Note

(I am not a lawyer and none of this is legal advice.) `keytool` is open source under the GNU
Public License (GPL). I did not copy or refer to the `keytool` source code when creating this
library. Everything here is based off of studying keystore files and reading publicly available
documentation. Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, this library is not subject to the
restrictions of the GPL.

If you intend to use this somewhere that may be subject to legal scrutiny (e.g. commercial
software), I encourage you to consult a lawyer to confirm that this library does not expose you
to any legal risk.
